# Linear Magnetic Hall Sensors

#### Project Overview

The Linear Magnetic Hall Sensors project demonstrates how to interface linear Hall sensors with an Arduino Nano to measure magnetic field strength. Linear Hall sensors are used in various applications such as position sensing, speed detection, and current sensing. This project provides a basic setup for reading analog values from a linear Hall sensor and displaying them on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Linear Hall Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Linear Hall Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the output pin of the linear Hall sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper voltage levels and grounding for stable operation of the linear Hall sensor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the linear Hall sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the Serial Monitor.
   - Observe the Serial Monitor to view the linear Hall sensor values displayed in real-time.
   - Introduce magnetic objects near the sensor to observe changes in sensor readings.

#### Applications

- **Position Sensing:** Use linear Hall sensors to detect the position of objects in linear motion.
- **Speed Detection:** Measure the speed of moving objects by detecting changes in magnetic field strength.
- **Current Sensing:** Utilize linear Hall sensors for non-invasive current sensing in electronic circuits.

#### Notes

- Experiment with different magnetic field strengths and distances to observe variations in sensor readings.
- Calibrate the sensor readings if necessary to account for environmental factors or sensor drift.
- Ensure proper shielding and interference mitigation techniques to minimize external magnetic influences on sensor accuracy.
